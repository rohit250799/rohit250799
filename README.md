Hi there 👋 I'm **Rohit Sarkar**

  🎯 **Aspiring Deep-Tech Backend & Fintech Quant Engineer**\
  💻 Python | Go | Linux | Networking | PostgreSQL\
  📍 Bangalore, India

🚀 **About Me**

I’m a backend engineer passionate about building high-performance systems that power financial markets, trading infrastructure, and blockchain networks.
With a Computer Applications degree and 3 years of backend development experience, I’m now focused on mastering quantitative development, financial systems, and deep-tech backend engineering — staying away from regular web development and aiming for low-latency, high-reliability systems in fintech.

📌 **Current Focus**
- Algorithmic Trading Infrastructure (Python, Go, Networking)
- Financial Systems Backend (Order matching, risk management engines)
- Blockchain Backend Infrastructure
- Market Data Processing & Low-Latency Systems
- Advanced Linux Networking for High-Performance Finance

📚 **What I’m Learning Now**
- Advanced Linux systems & networking for ultra-low-latency trading
- Quant finance fundamentals: derivatives, risk models, and market microstructure
- Database optimization for high-frequency data
- Concurrency & parallelism in Go and Python

🛠 **Tech Stack**

- **Languages**: Python, Go, SQL
- **Tools & Platforms**: Linux (Ubuntu), Docker, Git, PostgreSQL
- **Special Focus**: Networking protocols, performance tuning, financial data pipelines

📈 **Career Goal**

To engineer the next generation of financial infrastructure — from algorithmic trading engines to blockchain settlement systems — and grow into a Quantitative Developer / FinTech Backend Specialist.

🤝 **I’m Looking to Collaborate On**
- Low-latency trading engines and market data processing pipelines
- Blockchain backend infrastructure (transaction settlement, consensus optimization)
- Financial systems like risk management modules, order matching engines, and pricing models
- Networking-heavy backend systems for real-time data streaming
- Backend automation for finance, clearing, and settlement processes
